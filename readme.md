## Fifth Aeon - Bot Tool Kit
This repository contains a command line tool intended to make it easier to produce bots for the Fifth Aeon A.I competition.

### Getting Started
1. If you are not familiar with the Fifth Aeon card game's rules, then you should learn them by playing at [fifthaeon.com](https://fifthaeon.com). Don't skip this step, without knowing the rules you will be lost when making your bot.
2. Install the Bot Tool Kit using the instructions in the next section.
3. Run the BTK with `npm start` and choose "Create a new bot". Give your bot a unique name.
4. Navigate to your newly created bot in the src/bots folder.
5. Start working on implementing your bot. A great place to start is by looking at the documentation and source code for [DefaultAI](https://docs.fifthaeon.com/classes/_ai_defaultai_.defaultai.html).
6. Get help and help others by contributing to the [wiki](https://github.com/Fifth-Aeon/Fifth-Aeon-Wiki/wiki) or chatting on the [discord](https://discord.gg/QHqDae2).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository with submodules using the command `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FifthAeon/Bot-Tool-Kit.git` (if you don't already have git you can get it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
2. Install NodeJS version 10.x.x from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
3. Navigate your terminal into the folder you cloned the repository into and run `npm install` to get the dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the tool.
5. (Optional) I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor. If you want to follow the style of the default code install the [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) extension.
